          answer:
            "ChargeNextDoor exists to address the growing demand for accessible and convenient electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure, especially in residential areas where public charging stations may be limited. The platform connects homeowners who have EV chargers with EV owners who need a place to charge, allowing homeowners to earn money and EV drivers to find convenient charging spots nearby. By fostering a community-driven solution, ChargeNextDoor supports the transition to clean energy and a more sustainable, decentralized charging network.",

          title: "How is CND different from other charge sharing apps?",
          answer:
            `<p>ChargeNextDoor stands out from other EV charging apps in several key ways:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Homeowner-Centric Model:</strong> CND lets homeowners with Level 2 chargers become hosts, creating a decentralized, community-driven charging network.</li>
              <li><strong>Flexible, Local Access:</strong> CND helps connect EV owners with available chargers in their neighborhoods, making charging more convenient for those without a charger at home.</li>
              <li><strong>Peer-to-Peer Charging:</strong> Users connect directly with other EV owners and homeowners, offering more personalized, flexible charging options.</li>
              <li><strong>Income for Hosts:</strong> Homeowners can earn passive income by renting out their chargers.</li>
              <li><strong>Focus on Sustainability:</strong> CND supports the growth of home-based charging infrastructure, helping reduce carbon emissions and promote clean energy.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>These features make ChargeNextDoor more than just another charge-sharing appâ€”it empowers homeowners, improves convenience for EV owners, and supports a greener future.</p>`,

        {
          title: "Do I have to own an electric vehicle to be a host?",

            <p><strong>For Hosts:</strong></p>
            <ul>

              <li>A host's home insurance may cover property damage, but check with your provider.</li>
            </ul>

          answer:
          "As a host, your earnings depend on the pricing you set and the cost of electricity. If your home electricity rate is 30Â¢ per kWh and you use a standard 7.4kW charger, you can price your charging service based on kWh. For example, if a user consumes 40kWh per week, and you set your price at $0.50 per kWh, the total revenue per session would be $20 (if the User charges weekly). ChargeNextDoor takes a 10% fee, amounting to $2 per session. The electricity cost for 40kWh at $0.30 per kWh would be $12, leaving you with a profit of $6 per session. Over the course of a year, with one session per week, this could add up to approximately $312 in earnings from just one regular user.  "

        {
          title: "How do I decide what price to set for renting out my charger?",
          answer:
          `
          <p>As a host, you set a price ($AUD/kWh) for the charger; you're renting out your charger and not selling your electricity.</p>
          <p>When setting the price, you need to take into account the following:</p>
          <ul>
          <li><strong>What electricity will cost you:</strong> During the host setup process, the app provides guidance on the wholesale electricity price provided by your distributor in your location.</li>
         <li><strong>Wear and tear on your charger:</strong> Consider the maintenance and depreciation of your charger over time.</li>
         <li><strong>A decent amount to reward yourself:</strong> Ensure youâ€™re fairly compensated for providing the service.</li>
         <li><strong>The 10% fee:</strong> The app will take a 10% fee to keep running ChargeNextDoor (CND).</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Note:</strong> The price is subject to change at any time. However, any price adjustments are reviewed by us to ensure fairness and prevent monopolistic practices or price gouging, particularly in areas with low host penetration.</p>

          title: "When do I get paid?",
          answer:
          "Since payments are processed by a third-party provider (Stripe), youâ€™ll need to create a Stripe Express account when signing up as a host. This allows payments to be deposited directly into your bank account. The first payout typically takes longer (7â€“14 days), but after that, payouts will be processed weekly. "

          "This depends on individual circumstances and preferences. If you have the space to leave your car in a way that allows the driver easy access to the charger, thatâ€™s ideal. If accommodating this is more challenging, itâ€™s a matter of balancing the inconvenience against the potential income from hostingâ€”and, of course, the positive impact youâ€™re making! "

If the user cancels within 2 hour of the booking time, the pre-authorization amount will be refunded. If not, the pre-authorization is transferred to the host, and the driver will be charged a penalty fee which is 10% of the estimted charge amount.

Upon verification, the costs associated with the repair will be recovered from the Driverâ€™s account.

          title: "How is the amount to be paid calculated?",
          answer:
          `
            <p>When a user books a session with a host, an estimated cost is calculated based on the current charge level of the userâ€™s EV and the additional charge they wish to add. At the time of booking, a percentage of this estimated cost is pre-authorized on the userâ€™s payment method using Stripeâ€™s Payment Intents API with an authorization hold. This ensures the user has sufficient funds without immediately processing the charge.</p>

            <p>Once the user starts charging at the reserved time and ends the session, the actual cost of the session is determined based on the kWh consumed and the host's set rate. The pre-authorized amount is adjusted accordingly:</p>

            <ul>
            <li><strong>If the final cost is equal to or higher</strong> than the pre-authorized amount, Stripe captures the full amount or the final adjusted amount.</li>
            <li><strong>If the final cost is lower,</strong> the difference is released, and the user is only charged the actual amount.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In cases where the session is canceled or not completed, the pre-authorization hold will automatically expire after a certain period (typically 7 days, depending on the bank and Stripe settings).</p>
